            <p>The weather is a crucial factor in paragliding, as it can greatly affect the safety and success of a flight.

                The wind, temperature, humidity, and cloud cover all play a role in determining the conditions for a safe and enjoyable flight. Paragliding requires certain wind speeds and directions for takeoff and landing, as well as thermals to stay aloft.
                
                Additionally, the weather can also affect visibility and the potential for turbulence, which can make flying more challenging and dangerous.
                
                Paragliders need to be aware of the forecasted weather conditions before, during and after the flight, as changing weather conditions can quickly become hazardous.
                
                Monitoring the weather conditions and understanding how they can impact a flight is crucial, this is why we reccomend checking out the weather conditions before every flight.</p>
