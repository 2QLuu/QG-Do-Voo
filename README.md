## Testing 
    - While coding the website i originally had no problems and everything went smooth untill i started to change the size of my window and everything would instantly fall apart since ive used a lot of float commands so i tested around a lot and tried to do all the layouts without any float commands wich resolved the layout issues.


## Validator Testing

 - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validatorc (HTML)
